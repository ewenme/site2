It's sick when you finally get around to reading an OG writer and it slaps. So much back catalogue to sink some teeth into. But yeah *White Teeth* is the truth! I almost never find myself laughing out loud (or trying not to) from a book but Zadie has some different juice going on. There are so many loveable hot messes in these pages, she's respectfully cussing the whole tapestry of London life and never talking down.

It's mad that this is sandwiched between *Notting Hill* (1999) and *Bridget Jone's Diary* (2001). Probably the quintessential London films of that era, yet the real sauce was on these here pages all along.
