Just felt like the handbrake was left on a bit. Dipped a toe into real life shit but with a stiff upper lip tone. Once he gets going talking about memorable dubplates and sound clashes, that's the stuff, but unless you're an anorak about that then I imagine it could come off a bit chin-strokey (never mind the internal politics of various UK radio operations).

There's a good running bit where In every anecdote that involves him trying a spliff, he whities out. It's moving to finally understand how sound clashing meant he got to live out his dreams of acting, in a way. That fusion of stage performer and MC is the most interesting creative legacy, for me. I found my way in to his work through dubstep (_that_ Breakage record) and him recounting this second wind that came in his 50s was sweet. Love to Rodders, every time.
