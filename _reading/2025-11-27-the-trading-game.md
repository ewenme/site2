Disclaimer: I've been following [Garys Economics](https://www.youtube.com/c/GarysEconomics) since the [WallStreetBets GameStop shitshow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze) so a chunky parasocial relationship is likely colouring this review. My copy of the book is signed, for fuck's sake.

I swear Gary was asked about Mark Fisher [on Mediations for the anxious mind](https://youtu.be/K-pyDXLGHTM?si=TzKRac1ZymaZDrMm) and wasn't overly familiar but this is so much more *Capitalist Realism* dread than *Industry* titillation. Mark talked so sharply about the psychic damage that lofty, educated and vacuous environments inflict on working class people that fight so hard to get there. Gary reconstructs a disturbing play-by-play of exactly that journey with unflinching honesty and microscopic detail, featuring lovingly disgusting pictures of the characters that almost shattered his life.

I feel like Gary's north star is Skin In The Game. He respects traders more than economists because they are betting on their predictions. He is repulsed by the traders who's whole lives have been buttressed by giant safety nets of wealth and who will never be able to understand The Economy because they have never really participated in it. He can't bring himself to keep making trades because he is intimately connected to the people who will come to bear the consequences. Call him the cockney Nicholas Nassim Taleb.
