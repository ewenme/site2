tbh I don't have all that much original thought beyond Tim Rogers one-of-one [Action Button review of Final Fantasy VII Remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4H5ykBP0I). I was doomed to try and fail to love this game, it is maybe bad that it exists in the first place and I (along with many others) have foolishly wished it into existence. Nostalgia in this large a dose is often a sweet sorrow, rose-tinted glasses and all that. Frank Ocean was almost too on the nose with the PS1 start-up tones leaking into *Channel Orange*, but playing *Rebirth* feels like you're fracking (ironic for a game heavy on climate collapse) childhood memories that should've been left well alone.

The good news is that I don't feel any less fond of the original, nor am I down on a story that showed the 10 year-old me what art was capable of. The source material is timeless. The battles are good clean fun. The character models are so peng it's jokes. The *Yakuza* series' influence is hard to ignore during mini-game pile-ups and cutesy side missions (you might wonder why you aren't just playing *Yakuza*, though). I got well into Queen's Blood, the customary meta card game, with the missus.

They tried a little too hard to make this game, the awkward middle chapter of an assumed trilogy, meet the AAA "product standards". Stuff it with superfluous, second-tier shite to make sure there's 80+ hours of stuff for the sickos to do. I clocked it in 50 hours, mainlined most of the back half and was better for it.
