I'm Ewen and this here is my silly little corner of the world wide web. I'm semi-retired from social media and use this gaff to document bits and bobs from my life instead. My day job has basically fuck all to do with any of this and I try to treat it a sanctuary of sorts to share whatever I'm feeling today. I hope you can find something here that's a vibe. Shout me if u do !

Elsewhere URL, I just started a project called [Side Missions](https://sidemissions.substack.com/) for sharing collagic audio essays. I'm also 1/2 of your fav DJ supergroup's fav DJ supergroup&#8482;, [Cloud 696](https://cloud696.club/).
