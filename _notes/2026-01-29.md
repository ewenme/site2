Didn't write anything yesterday so here's a BOGOF.

### Wednesday
Cooked with Jerusalem artichokes for the first time. Got a bunch from Roz @ the allotments on Sunday. A big concern in the household was how to combat the violent flatulence that they bring on. Now, I didn't know about this, but I soon would. Nadine read that soaking them in lemony water for an hour fixes the problem, so I dunked them for about half an hour and figured that would prevent the worst of it. They were pretty tasty to be fair, I didn't know they were like potato basically. By nighttime, they roared back into effect. The less said about that, the better. 

### Yesterday
I've been reading Malcom X's autobiography before bed over the last few weeks. Today was a great chapter. He basically went on a multi-day bender in Boston while in a feud with an OG hustler, culminating in passing out while trying to deliver a hundred joints to some prostitutes and them helping him to bed. I don't read many autobiographies but this is the good stuff. It's so important that punches aren't pulled and the subject is an open book for them to be worthwhile. Proper into it.
