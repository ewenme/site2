I had to go into the cafe this morning and take my medicine from bossman who was ready to remind me when he told me Villa would beat Newcastle on the weekend. I accepted my fate willingly after pretending I couldn't speak English. I got irritated when the inevitable 'sack the manager?' discourse got brought up. In my mind, this fan jitteriness is a post social media phenomenon. I lived through the Mike Ashley + Pardew era, mate. I was born in the darkness, moulded by it. Playing some good football and being in with a sniff of silverware is all I need.

Went to my Farsi lesson after work. It was OK, I sort of learnt how to talk about what I did at the weekend. "Yesterday, I went to the cinema with my wife and saw the film Hamnet", that sort of patter. Still trying to traverse from talking like a prick to sounding like a normal person. That must be a good feeling, I've never moved beyond GCSE in another language so I haven't done it before. That's the north star, just try and chat regular.

Got a food waste bin from the council. Was a right palava trying to find the right spot for it in the kitchen. Just put it on the floor next to the main bin, for now. I don't love it. Watch this space.
