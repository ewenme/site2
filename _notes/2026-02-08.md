Had an interesting chat with the in-laws today about dyeing hair and growing old. It was a conversation that had a tragic, insurmountable paradox at the heart of it. My perhaps naive argument against dyeing hair (as a response to ageing) centred on:

- growing old is a blessing and I want to embrace it (*gags*)
- getting adjusted to greys slowly over time seems much less earth-shattering than a whole head full of them overnight
- I want people who would treat me differently for being (and looking) older to stay far away from me anyway so I can protect my energy
- can't be fucked

The elders in this conversation had a different perspective. Sadly, I can't know for sure if I'll feel this way in ten, twenty years. I have to go through the fire and see what I actually do. I might come back to this and have a good laugh.
