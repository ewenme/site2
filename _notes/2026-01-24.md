Went to Tempo's first "Move and Mix" session of the year in the morning. Little 3k run up to the Rye, warm up and warm down, then a DJ and cotch for a couple hours. Was wicked to catch up with people and listen to some tunes in the Carpet Shop. Fit in a little b2b2b at the end, played an old Boofy tune called *More or Less* that warranted a run out on a good system. Had a couple of DMCs about siblings and social development, and the lost art of Playing Out. Also shared my first ever car, the legendary '01 1.0l electric blue Corsa, via Google streetview from 2008.

Was back in Peckham in the evening to catch the early-ish showing of *Hamnet* with Nadine. Arms full with the usual combo of a medium sweet popcorn and barely smuggled beer (plus a couple of unnecessary emergency bananas). She got a peppermint tea and pick n mix. I have a hard time deciding if I liked the film. On one hand, the acting is consistently great and it looks lovely. On the other hand, the heavy invisible hand of corny Hollywood has it's mitts all over the (rightly) emotional centrepiece scenes. Noticed Spielberg and Sam Mendes were producers and it shows. I feel like there's a time and a place for that sort of thing and this wasn't it. In spite of that, you don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater innit. 7/10 'cos I'm feeling generous.
