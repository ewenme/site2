I've got fuck all to share from today, apart from one thing. When I went on a run this evening, I got snuck up on by a fox. I was just catching breath and saw a shadow. Turned around and there they were, nonchalantly following me. I jumped a bit, felt a bit embarrassed. Did they notice? The foxes in my ends are moving mad. I think I'm petting one by the time the year's out. That's my 2026 prediction.
