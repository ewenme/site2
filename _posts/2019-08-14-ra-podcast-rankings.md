[Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/) (RA) have run a (roughly) weekly [podcast mix series](https://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast.aspx) since late 2010 (and still going strong). Each edition sees a new artist sequence a mix. I've been tuning in for a long time, and got to wondering which artists have been featured most prominently throughout the archives.

[MixesDB](https://www.mixesdb.com/w/Main_Page) is the self-proclaimed "database for DJ sets, podcasts, radio shows and more". Over there, fans can enter metadata for mixes, including tracklists (i.e. which tracks were played). There's even an [RA Podcast section](https://www.mixesdb.com/w/Category:Resident_Advisor_Podcast), which means that tracks played within mixes in this series are collated in one place (albeit with some missing data). This would help cure my curiosity.

I've started a collection of mix entries and tracklistings data for RA, and other prominent mix series, within the [mixes](https://github.com/ewenme/mixes) GitHub repo (the code is there, too, if you fancy riffing off of this on your own projects). Most of the data is parsed from MixesDB [who openly admit](https://www.mixesdb.com/w/Help:General) that there can be mistakes (the data is entered by community contributors, remember), so [file an issue](https://github.com/ewenme/mixes/issues) if you see anything fugazi.
