[Berghain](http://berghain.de/) is (in)famous for many things. The strict no photography and door policies (which you can take on, VR-style, via [berghaintrainer](https://berghaintrainer.com/)), for starters. It also puts on cool parties, sometimes...

What's also cool is, Berghain's site still hosts their programming history on the site. This goes all the way [back to 2009](http://berghain.de/events/2009-12) (check Hudson Mohawke vs. Rustie on the WARP 20 night - I miss Rustie ðŸ˜­). Some really neat projects have taken advantage of this public archive, like Artiom Dashinsky's [Numbers of Berghain](http://dashinsky.com/berghain-statistics/) piece (which, in turn, makes use of [Olle Holmberg's googlesheet collating 2009-2017 events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_OJHzKBwDFIK0YoLSX65g-jp_5djxx-9d4x1-LKUsw/edit#gid=1355724553)).

I managed to pull listings from December 2009 through to July 2019 (at time of writing), now hosted in [this aptly-named GitHub repo](https://github.com/ewenme/berghain). Here's the kind of stories you can quickly get into with it.
