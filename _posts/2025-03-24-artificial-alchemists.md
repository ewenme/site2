## Introduction

In 1981, Japanese proto-cyberpunk author and certified real one Izumi Suzuki penned the short story *Night Picnic*. She tells us of four alien lifeforms attempting to reconstruct a nuclear family from the remnants of books and TV that the human race left behind. The “daughter” tries desperately to simulate teenage angst “correctly” but does it at the wrong time. The “dad” insists that “the man of the house” reads the morning paper, so cobbles together a makeshift gazette from scraps of old newspapers that he fetches from the mailbox at 5am each morning. These rituals and rights of passage are jarringly performed rather than felt, as the charade slowly unravels. Culture itself is reduced to a pose that can be embodied by not just anyone, but any *thing*.

Not long ago, I passed through *The Call* at London’s Serpentine Gallery, an exhibition put together by Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst featuring fifteen community choirs from all over the UK. Down to the Spectrum Singers of Penarth, South Wales, over to Belfast’s HIVE Choir and up to the Carnoustie Choir on Scotland’s east coast. Each of these choirs were put through a series of singing exercises and given a songbook of hymns to perform, with the recordings consensually fed into choral AI models as training data that exhibition visitors could interact with. Angelically enveloped in a pure white curtain, the call of my voice carried into a microphone plated with gold and self-importance. The response of the choir’s collective, generative pipes were echoed back to me. As audio played back, on a purely sonic level the results are close to well-trodden effects like the talk box or Auto-tune. As the one doing the calling, the experience I felt was closer to a seance.

In a pristine press release, the pair posit the work as a proposal for “new cultural, legal, and technical rituals for art in the age of AI.” What does that even mean, though? Breaking through the PR polish, I think they want you to imagine what an AI artistic practice *with soul* might manifest as. Rituals are community traditions that form the backbones of human societies, often sacred and not committal to logic. Choirs have quietly gone about preserving musical traditions from aeons past, so can AI models commune with them into the distant future? Can it be done with charm and with dignity for the humans involved? Wading into the AI art debate isn’t the one if you want to look after your peace, but there’s a thread I want to pull on today and see where it goes.

## Timeless

There aren’t many phrases I find more squeamish than “multidisciplinary artist”, but Goldie is one of the few contemporary figures that might be able to claim it cringe-free. I first came across him in Guy Ritchie’s Y2K crime caper classic (at least in this house), *Snatch*. Here he is playing “Bad Boy Lincoln”, alongside Robbie Gee:

He briefly starred in *Eastenders*, too. Wouldn’t you know it, here he is performing with Robbie again!

Much later on, I discovered that Goldie was a notable “B-boy” in the 80s on both sides of the Atlantic, from Brum to the Bronx.  Here’s a clip from a BBC TV debate, originally aired October 1987, which pitted him opposite Superintendent Fowler of the West Midlands Police to debate whether graffiti is art, crime or both:

In my late teens, I learnt that this same guy was also, incredibly, a Jungle/DnB pioneer in his own right. This was a headfuck of dizzy proportions, even beyond the realisation that Martin Kemp (AKA Eastenders’ Steve Owen) was in Spandau Ballet. 90s/00s *Eastenders* casting was the true avant garde. 

Goldie’s debut album, *Timeless*, is critically-acclaimed and marvelled as a pioneering piece of music so unanimously that offering up my silly little words about it now feels almost distasteful. The record was released in 1995, at a time when Jungle had experienced a taste of mainstream crossover success but hadn’t yet reached coffee table book / Mercury prize consideration territory, if you get my drift. *Timeless* got everyone noticing this sound of the future, and leading the charge was a lead single taken from the gargantuan 21-minute album opener, *Inner City Life* featuring the late, great Diane Charlemagne.

30 years later, Goldie is still being pestered for the story behind *Inner City Life*. Here he is talking to DJ Mag about the glamorous, romantic shuttle runs he braved to and from Rob Playford’s mum’s house in Stevenage: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CkRvpZijaw

For someone intertwined with the development of a new musical genre, the man is a self-avowed technophobe and open about his lack of technical abilities in the studio. To quote:

> Technology is a velvet claw. I hate it, but I have to use it. Technology is not my master; when I use technology, I take it for a joyride. I fuck it up and make it do things it was never designed to do.

In the *Timeless* days, he worked with engineer and *Moving Shadow* label-head Rob Playford to translate the unorthodox ideas rattling around his head into something material. In his own words, Rob describes their working relationship like so:

> Goldie has a very vivid imagination, and knows nothing about the technical side of the process. Meanwhile, my imagination has been stunted by the familiarity I have with the electronics… The kind of music that I've been involved with didn't need a music producer in the classic mould; it needed a technical producer.

To put it another way, Playford was holding the paintbrush and Goldie was dictating who, what, when, where and why to paint. Chatting to the Guardian, he was even more ruthless in his own assessment, saying of Playford:

> He’s a phenomenal engineer, but he doesn't have his own ideas, he doesn't make his own music. But what he does have is a fantastic width and berth to throw loads of creative ideas at him.

Dillinja, Danny J, Tech Itch, Mark Rutherford and others would all take turns sitting in the engineering hot-seat for Goldie. He went on to develop an unmistakeable signature sound and never-seen-before production techniques. B-boy breaks like James Brown’s *Funky Drummer* and Dyke & The Blazers’ *Let a Woman Be a Woman - Let a Man Be a Man* made it into early records, likely a hangover from his stateside galavanting. He’s credited with the invention (or popularisation, at least) of “time stretching”,  broken down for the masses in Channel 4’s "How Clubbing Changed The World" documentary by Fabio:

Goldie was able to express himself using cutting-edge of digital music production technology, despite being one step removed from the act of pressing buttons. When I think about how to approach new technology in an artistic practice without sacrificing one’s soul, there’s something of a parable to learn here. Admittedly, these creative swings didn’t always connect (see Noel Gallagher’s cynical cameo on 1997’s *Temper, Temper*, for example), but a mercurial spirit trying for masterpieces would rather shoot for the stars and miss than not take the shot.

(As an aside, Goldie has to receive partial blame for the nauseating trend of cutting-edge electronic music getting the full orchestra treatment to “elevate” it. Pete Tong, another serial offender here, happened to sign *Timeless* while an A&R at Polydor-owned London Records. What was in the water, these times?). 

## Ghosts in the machine 

If Goldie is the prototype for AI art optimism, the resilience of ghost-writing might be the best case for declaring a Butlerian Jihad (AKA blowing up a few data centres). In all seriousness, hacks have been harvesting the creative juices of others since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was out here. *The Requiem* was a composition that was left unfinished on his death in 1791, finished off by his Austrian pupil Franz Xaver Süssmayr in 1792 before being delivered to German aristocrat Count Franz von Walsegg. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi8vJ_lMxQI

The Count, who had a grubby reputation for passing off commissions as his own work, had requested Mozart make the piece for a service to commemorate his late wife, Anna. Legend has it that before he could claim this one for his own, a public benefit concert for Mozart’s widow Constanze scuppered the plans. Far from an isolated vanity project, wealthy aristocrats regularly tapped up gifted composers of the day to make something beautiful they could tell their mates, and themselves, they had gifted the world. That’s right, “cultural capital” or “clout” has been an obsession since at least the 18th century, bravely preserved until today by the vampiric elites of a decidedly creaking Popstar industrial complex.

There are obvious ghost-writing reference points amongst these circles, but more nuanced and relevant here is a case like Lupe Fiasco. Fresh off the first iteration of his “Rap Theory and Practice” MIT course, he hooked up with Google for a “Lab Session” to “see how AI might expand a rapper’s lyric writing process”. Here, Lupe contextualises the writing session with a potted history of Hip Hop innovation:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYp18JAvKkQ

The creative friction between the technologists and artist are telling. One mentions thinking that Lupe would be interested in exploring how an AI assistant could write raps _for_ him and gets coldly shot down. Instead, Lupe was interested in recruiting the tech to identify the “universe of possibilities” branching from a word or concept he might be meditating on. The geeks worked with him to build *TextFX*, a collection of tools built on fine-tuned Large Language Models (or LLMs) that provide a web of lexical possibilities from a provided “prompt”. For example, the “Fuse” tool finds intersections between two things. Given the words “Spain” and “troll”, I was told:

> Spain and trolls both have a reputation for being mischievous—Spain for its history of pirates and explorers, and trolls for their penchant for playing pranks and causing trouble.

In the session, Lupe plays with these tools to lay down a rough track called *Glass of Water*. Here’s a snippet: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZVw06KceXA

Imagine a continuum of creative oversight that extends from a serene solo writers retreat to heavy-handed robot overlords in the vibe of Microsoft Office’s *Clippy*. To me, Lupe’s experiment sits closer to the latter, with Goldie’s process in the former camp. A cynical read here is that Goldie used a studio engineer as a glorified translator, while Lupe is using AI as a creative crutch under Google’s careful watch. However, consider the relative experience and technical fluency of both artists — while Goldie was raw and learning the trade during these early sessions with Playford, Lupe is dabbling with a more invasive approach *after* putting in the proverbial 10,000 hours. Does this mean that he is better able to notice, and therefore consciously accept or reject, the invisible pen of the machine short-circuiting the right side of his brain? Or, is this a potential slippery slope into late-career laziness and derivative art?

## Close

The digital tea leaves are saying that all roads are leading us towards a not-so-distant-future in which AI will be creating “art” that most people won’t be able to tell apart from the man-made equivalent. In [a recent study published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1), most people couldn’t spot AI-generated poetry and actually rated those poems higher than human-authored ones. [Scott Alexander ran an AI art Turing Test](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-did-you-do-on-the-ai-art-turing) that demonstrated widespread inability to identify AI paintings from (JPEG approximations) of famous artwork. One critique to square here would be that poetry and paintings are arguably ”heritage” art forms without mainstream appeal anymore. Nevertheless, it’s undeniable that inflection points like this are hitting with increasing regularity. 

Circling back to the nagging question I took away from *The Call* — what does an AI art practice with a soul look like — aside from predictably and pathetically wondering what Mark Fisher would’ve had to say about all this, I’m anxious to know how far along on the road to real craftsmanship in a given medium someone is. Until an artist has unlocked an unmistakeable clarity of self-expression and an intimacy with the creative act itself, working from idea to a real (or metaphorical) page with monkish dedication, my pound-shop Taoist advice is: be like Goldie. Prioritise the craft vigilantly and try to find your tribe like your life depends on it. As the neural pathways that carry your own creativity are strengthened through discipline and practice, something essential to your spirit gets fed at the same time. Remember at school, when the teacher would say, “if you cheat on the exam, you are only cheating yourself”? They might’ve had a point, you know. There may come a time when only you will know if you were the creator of art or just a puppet, at which point your own integrity and sense of meaning is what’s at stake. Learn to embrace failure, engage in play and trust your own voice before letting anything get between you and your pen. 

I’ve conveniently left aside the labour question in all of this, because it’s a big one. One component of Holly and Matt’s exhibition concerned how to involve humans in any AI project and practice informed consent. The moody, adolescent elephant in the room is that the post-AI, Goldie-equivalent of today might be in a bedroom somewhere trying to make magic with a Palo Alto tech companies robot equivalent of Matt Playford in lieu of a thriving “scene”. This isn’t a direction of travel specific to music, but it helps to “act local” when faced with systemic, societal problems. The “first ever” [global study of the impact of AI on the music industry](https://mixmag.net/read/music-industry-workers-lose-quarter-income-ai-2028-study-finds-news) estimates that, by 2028, musician income will decrease by 24% and Generative AI music will represent 20% of traditional music streaming platforms’ revenues. History would suggest that no one is coming to save them. 

It’s hard to think that “fine art” like *The Call*, with institutional support and high-brow editorial column inches, will be in the crosshairs of genAI. For this reason, I am dying to know what artists with less proximity to art institutions think about all this. I have a grain of (perhaps misguided) faith that “underground” music makers on the (relative) margins will see their creations elevated and celebrated harder as the artificial slop begins to swill. First to be buried will be the paint-by-numbers house bops and vacuous pop landfill that proudly provide window dressing for tech-bro coding sessions and yummy mummy spin classes. Is this all cope? I’ll end on something Mat Dryhurst says that does resonate with me:

> AI [really, technology] just changes what we value about art.

Personally, I feel my own goalposts moving. I can no longer take for granted that the boring, moving or batshit art I stumble across was made by a real person. Be it a random Sunday digging on BandCamp, or maybe a painting I find in a charity shop in fifty years time. The moments when I get a glimpse into how a person was feeling when they made something, when they are generous enough to share that, are even more precious now. Keep making cool shit, for you and your mates, from the heart.
